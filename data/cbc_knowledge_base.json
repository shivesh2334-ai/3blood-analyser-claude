It is very common to observe hemolyzed blood samples due to small gauge needles or tourniquets that are too tight, leading to shearing of red blood cells (RBCs). Hemolysis during phlebotomy spuriously decreases the RBC count, hematocrit, and may falsely elevate potassium. Proper technique requires: avoiding small-gauge needles (<23G), limiting tourniquet time (<1 minute), and gently mixing the collected tube by inversion 8-10 times to prevent clotting without causing hemolysis."

EDTA may cause platelet clumping or satellitism in some patients, leading to pseudothrombocytopenia. Platelet aggregates can also falsely increase the white blood cell (WBC) count. If EDTA-related pseudothrombocytopenia is suspected, repeat the sample in a citrate (blue-top) or heparin tube. The ratio of anticoagulant in a tube to blood is carefully calibrated: underfilling leads to overexposure to EDTA (falsely low platelet count, altered MCV), while overfilling can lead to clotting and inaccurate results."

Samples should be refrigerated (4\u00b0C) if the analysis is to occur up to 72 hours after collection. Freezing of blood samples must be absolutely avoided; freezing will cause cells to lyse, leading to completely inaccurate values. Blood samples exposed to heat will cause RBCs to fragment, producing significant anisocytosis and bizarre microcytes resembling blood samples seen in burn victims. Samples greater than 72 hours old should not be used for CBC testing as they can show spurious results including elevated MCV and altered platelet morphology. Blood films should be prepared within eight hours of sample collection; with longer storage, cells become pyknotic with altered morphology that can lead to spurious identification of dysplasia in WBCs."

A very low MCHC (less than 28 g/dL) may also be spurious and can be caused by hyperglycemia creating osmotic imbalance. MCHC is generally one of the most stable CBC parameters in a healthy individual, so deviations should prompt quality review."

The RDW is most useful in patients with microcytic anemia: an elevated RDW is consistent with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and a normal RDW is consistent with anemia of chronic disease/inflammation (ACD/AI) or thalassemia trait. RDW has been proposed as a tool to distinguish iron deficiency (elevated RDW) from thalassemia trait (normal RDW) in samples with low MCV. However, thalassemia trait can also cause an elevated RDW, so this distinction is imperfect. A very elevated RDW can also be seen in transfused anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and hemoglobinopathies."

Very low MCHC values are typical of iron deficiency anemia.

      "text": "Anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation (ACD/AI) is one of the most common causes of anemia in hospitalized patients. It is associated with chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, malignancy, and organ failure. Pathophysiology: elevated hepcidin (acute phase reactant) leads to iron sequestration in macrophages, reducing iron available for erythropoiesis. CBC features: typically normocytic (MCV 80-100 fL) or mildly microcytic, low reticulocyte count. Key labs: ferritin normal or elevated (acute phase protein), serum iron low, TIBC low (distinguishes from iron deficiency where TIBC is elevated), transferrin saturation low. Treatment is directed at the underlying condition. EPO-stimulating agents may be used in chronic kidney disease or chemotherapy-related anemia."

      "text": "Neutrophilia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 7.7 \u00d7 10\u2079/L (some laboratories use 8.0). It may be due to increased bone marrow production and/or demargination of peripheral blood neutrophils. The peripheral WBC count is only a crude reflection of neutrophil production, since the vast majority of neutrophils are present in the bone marrow. Approximately half of circulating neutrophils are reversibly adherent to the endothelium ('marginated'), so processes that increase neutrophil demargination (catecholamines, exercise, corticosteroids) can rapidly elevate the WBC count within minutes without increased marrow production. Sustained neutrophilia (>1-2 weeks) is more likely to represent true increased production."

Physiologic causes: exercise and stress (rapid demargination), pregnancy, asplenia/post-splenectomy (moderate neutrophilia with thrombocytosis and Howell-Jolly bodies), smoking (raises WBC ~25%, mechanism unclear)."

In leukemoid reaction \u2014 LAP score is elevated, BCR-ABL1 is absent, clinical context shows infection/inflammation, neutrophilia often decreases with treatment of underlying cause.

Classic pentad (now rare): MAHA + thrombocytopenia + fever + neurological symptoms + renal dysfunction. ADAMTS13 activity <10% confirms TTP.

Physiologic anemia of pregnancy: plasma volume increases ~50%, RBC mass increases ~25% \u2014 relative dilutional effect. Most common cause of true anemia: iron deficiency (increased iron demand for fetal development, expanded RBC mass, blood loss at delivery). Features: low MCV, low MCH, elevated RDW, low ferritin. Folate deficiency also common, especially if dietary intake poor or multiple gestation. Routine screening: CBC at first prenatal visit and 28 weeks. Postpartum: CBC to evaluate blood loss anemia. Treatment: oral iron supplementation for IDA; folate supplementation (also prevents neural tube defects)."

The Coulter principle: cells passing through an electrically charged aperture cause resistance changes proportional to cell volume. Light scattering: cells hydrodynamically focused in a flow cell are illuminated by laser; light scattered at different angles provides information on cell size, complexity, and contents. Five-part WBC differential uses combinations of DC impedance, radiofrequency conductivity, light scatter, peroxidase staining, and fluorescent RNA/DNA dyes. Flags for abnormal WBCs indicate cells at the monocyte/neutrophil interface (BLAST flag), large lymphoid cells (ATYPICAL LYMPH flag), or neutrophil left shift. Flagged samples require review of peripheral blood smear."

Key characteristics: isolated neutropenia without anemia or thrombocytopenia, no increased susceptibility to infection (normal immune response), family history of low neutrophil counts, stability over time. BEN should be suspected in an asymptomatic patient from a high-prevalence population with mild neutropenia and an otherwise normal CBC.

Evaluation: confirm no cytopenias in other cell lines, check family members, rule out drug causes, ensure no history of recurrent infections."

Reticulocyte Hemoglobin Content (CHr or RET-He on Sysmex): measures hemoglobin content of reticulocytes, which reflects iron availability for erythropoiesis in the past 3-4 days. CHr <26 pg is the earliest indicator of functional iron deficiency, preceding changes in ferritin, serum iron, or MCV. This is particularly useful in monitoring dialysis patients on EPO therapy and in diagnosing iron deficiency in inflammatory states where ferritin may be falsely elevated."
